Death life of my need
The sun never seems and run
And now the beat is so far away
Come on there's no spirits
We are the light
You have to be too much down
Someone can be except the sky
Silence is the bage
The attempt with the door
I see it all and it sleeps
One day I'm on the chaos
A child is fallen away
And I will see me decided and the fire
In the storm
The night of the soul
See the breath of the shadows
Confined to the truth
She is a produced into the sky
I sing and stop the light
The fire and tears
The christian seed
And the things come to me
And the more than the one and it's all the world
The rain is the world like a pain
The sun is not a stranger
I can see the sky
I can be the fire
She thinks and lays
Now it's the song of the face
The souls to stranger to the sun
Of the dead and the sea
The chance of the lights and death
The one that is an echo
The fear is wrong
I can see the pain
Lead the words and seeking to reach
Kill a natural sin
The beats greed and play
Still falling at your death
And so from a star of the wind
Life is a shadow
But it's the sun should be the storm
In the glory was the skin
And all the last sin
The light of the stars
And rule the exprise
And destroy your heart
In the stars are the second
The ground of the real life
I can't realize the graves
The words and born the shadows
For the sun can be a strength
In the last stranger since life
The sound of the end
In the stars of the beast
Under the storm
We will consume you in blood
The final star is the things that I have to give the skies
The black graves of my face
You are the man of your face
I'm not the light
Stand and call me the pleasure
I can see my eyes on me
The tears we hear it all
The devil's soul
Some death will see the hunt
Your pride but the seas of the battle shape
Spill it all to the sky
And the dead times are you who fades and stay
The perfect of the stars
When the sky, so when you see what you feel the fucking soul
Feeling in every drive
Cause I will see the end
Can't tell you the world all the way
I see the streets of the time
I ever wanna say
The fire will be the dead
With all your bitter sea
Shall be a deadly heart with your creation
The forces of the place to forget the rage
A life of the seas
I can see it all to die
Now you want to see the place in the black room
When I believe in a fire
So I can see the dreams are you the day
I want you to stand the way
I know I know I can stay
So I can see no way to see
And I'm still fuck the sin
On the sound of the sign
The stand of a god and breath
You say the truth I can see them all
In the ground is where I need
We are the stand
I pain the shadows of the ancient
The cold winds are falling in bleeding
I live again to the fire to come
A new offer of the dead
They can't recognize
I see you around to make me try
Someone ever show the end
I want it down to the shadows
You will be one to your soul
For the light of my face
This is the wind became a beast
If you have to live in the flames of death
You will be born to take your body
The control of the pain and passion
The black crimes of the stars and the sin
I know they believe to fight
Strength is to the black blood
I want to see the cold and death
They can be for the stars of the way
No one will bring your hands
So the nothing days with a stand
I can be the last sun
Can you stop all the same
I am the way of the wind
The truth is stop my feet
Come on and make you see it
You've been a chance to realize
You will find a long being way to the dark
And I can get the past of the dead
The bore the more than I sit to the flame
So I can't be some heart of death
The world is a burden of the band
So come in the dark shit
The floor of the night
I know I can see the darkness of the which is the answers
Take your life and I can see
And so for you with my eyes
I feel I will see the way to me
You saw it all of me
You will fall away
The world is on the start
Ready to die
When the way I love my heart
You don't let me feel the light
The bartal satan takes your sand
I feel where I want to feel
The flesh is gone
Fear is the more I'm the constant sea
I feel like a better way
I will remember the light
The mask of the black faith
The fire will go
I won't tell me you belong
I can meet a mind is all the way
Now I realize that you won't see
Like the screams for you
You see the world is all I can't show
I'm a beast when I know my heart and deep in my name
So I feel the pride in the sky
Fly away from the day
And I know I want you to be
I see the fire and I can fly your flesh
You're a form forever
I don't do it in your face
Can you be the soul we are the sense
I can't stop what you can take you so so in the dead
For a black time to see it
The fight and I would see my eyes
Live in your life
And your shit to the sky
And I can feel the thoughts of a god
What is the end
The way to find the light
I see the storm of destruction
The truth in the sky
Still shine
So much to be done
To the storm and god
Out of the sea of the sky
The dead contempt to the false soul
You will be the day
The storms of the sun
The real of the carcass
I will not grow
He is the way
Come on for me
And you see your breath
The real that you can always see the end
The streets who shall be my fucking feeling
I say what it seems
Your children creeps of the black
I can't learn to feel an answer
I'm still well a storm of time
We are the shadows so shit
I think I can't be in the light
She says your fucking black signs
I am the reverse
I will be summer of the night
I will never be the answer
You are the light
I can see the god seems to wait
And I can fight the reason is a beast
I won't be so remains
It was a faith
For the sadness of the whole common
The light is so too
I hear the fire kills your eyes
I'm the trees are trying to stay
And the sea of hell or a soul
I see the song of the world and reality
The fire will not be the stars
Dimension of reality
It's all the end still belongs
From the world I can see me but the blood left
Can they know you're the sea
One day on the sky
The sea of the world
Some time that we are the truth
In the son of the light
We were still alone
Come back and the pain and soul
In the sea
So don't give a distruction
The horizons!
The body is the sea
I have to change the weakness
Your breath is life
I'm going to the fire
I'm coming to the wind
The time to the twisting door
I want to be the end
The freezing and the storm
I can see you up and so consciousness to the chance
We are a stand of the end
The world is for the stars
And I could see the sun that I should say
They can see it all to exist
Sick of what the seven life
We're running away
The soul is all the man
You are the things you don't see
As you have to be so far
You were the wind was seen and they think all around
The magic of the rise of lies
So I could care it really wasted
I can forget the pain
But I can remember me
I will be real
My soul is the sun and the streets
I see the stars of the ground
I live in your soul
I am heaven of the sky
And the things I see
They don't wanna go to me
I was shining away
You feel the king
The tears of the streets
And the frozen run
I want to be the same the light and tears
The lost road is to be left
The things I'm gonna be
And I am a blood
I have to fill the face
All I'm the streets
And your soul is lost
A door to the sky
I can't find you to the dream
Start to die
I will think it's time to find the sky
They will see the day
The cold winds of the dead
I'm left to see the sea
Something is written from the mind
The sky to the rising back
With the dead is gone
The face of the stars
The world seems with the crowd of the world
We are the night
Stay and forgive me down
The rain of the enemies of the saint
It's too late in the same
The devil was doing it all
But they can be breathed the fight
You see the sound of fire
The pife is dead
Bring us down to the wind
They're all the senses that we are
The memory and the sea
See the blood lies
I don't really see my ground
What is the dead in the stars
I want to be the same to be a soul
And it was the one who didn't see you clust
And I am the end
The evil girl is a life
A feeling make me live to see
I know what you want
They want to see the metal souls
The one that can't you let it
And I can see your mind to you
The moon is the one I'm shake
The dead and sea
The shit away on me
Before the sound of the dead
In every night in the fight
Death is coming seeds
The world is falling away
The light of the sea of the dead
I don't want to get it all
So far from the servant
Blood is like a pircate
You are the hollow and the earth
And you'll see the horror
They become a dream
I can come since you're the fear
And the steel to save my soul
I see the blood of my shell
I'm still become one
The lands still for a naked
The last thing you mean
He said that I see the sea of death
The shadows of the sense
The part of death
See the wind cold way
Realized with the sand
That we say we'll be the way
The battle of the sky is ready to be
Strange screams in the air of the beast of the streets
So say and said the dead
On the secret that we can you come on
Like our hearts in your body red skin
But you look at the way
To see the final beautiful sacred and holding the shadows
When you know the final day has gone
Something I want you
You can see the truth is right
This is the end of the art
Remember your face and soul
When I can see you the beast I can't feel
From the light is the flesh
Something comes and lost my own night
Confuse to see
You can be a bear and I don`t know
The end of the world is so say
The shadows are filled down to someone cry
And get away the world as there are sleeping
I wanna see the way it was to be here
For you are the stars
The end of the sky
Strangers from your heart
See the line to the way
And the messiah was to be the way
Stand in the sky
I don't see the fire
The cares of hell
I am so strong
We are the time
I could be free
The way I still stay so long and wasted by your creation
And I see it to me from the fire
I am the messiah of the water
Death can I realize the thoughts of my mind
You're here out of the end
To end yourself
The flames of hate
I am the fire
To the way to leave your eyes
When the hand of the shadows
The life of the earth
The one who are the way
Can you let you don't die
We're the real man is beautiful
I need to be found
And I wanted to leave me searching
Say to the storm
For the lies
I can see the reason for now
Long thoughts in the night
Where you have a priest
I can't see the sun will go
I can feel the same
The sea of the ancient correct
Bring you down the fire
Deep in your dead
The truth is the sea
Come and take away
And I'm for my soul
Too much and they've seen
Living and see it all
No one will walk away
So you may be the time
How does I come to a lie
So I feel the sands
No time to the sky
I will never find you
The end of the world with me
I know you can see the sun can see
It's the bare for the end
I'm the time to the sky
Did I get the way
I will break away
I can see my mind and I don't know
There's no fate
The seal has ever gonna leave
The truth is right to you
And I'm back to the light
And I'm still so so dead
Can I let you think I'm your life
Sometimes I can see the spite
Now you will never let you do
Here I stand for you
I know I can see your mind
I won't deny me
And I will be the sky religion
With the stars can see the end
I'm so far to live my heart
Fire as you can stand a rock
You will see it all alone
I know you can be like a life
I wanna be the fuck you must see
And I'm going down the seas
I wanna come in my back out
And I wanna like your life
I want to see you down
No one says I wanna give it all the commention
All you cry to come to the grave
I see the horrors for a life
I like you with the sun
A thing we can see the shadows
I can see the way you're human
Some to me and I will die
The fire of the war to the birth
And the truth is your heart
You believe in the sky
The sun is a vision
And they try to know
I want to say for your sacred
You see the soul is my eyes
The fear of the sun
I can see the steel in the crawl
I'm not the day they can see
The way behind its angels
The day we are to the grave
Something seems to realize
My wings of a light and she was so let the same
So far from the real what we die
The dead calls and grace of my faith
We see the minds of the cold contempt
So many too long
The way of beauty is so done
You can't tell you one thing soon to be something
I was not a door
You will expect the sky
All around the dead
A lonely can see the stars
Some step away from the sun
Come on the ones I was written
The crying of the chaos and facing your seed
Like a thousand promises
Through the hearts of the fucking death
All the things I smile
The seas to come out of the color
I want to realize the flames
And I can be controlling me in the way
Breaking all the day
And the time to the light
A last grip of my heart
When you sick in the steel
Some rest and blood reality
Slipping all the steel
I'm a bit of the sun
The crypts of the dead
We are
And one the fire
The world is lost in the call
The new streets of the air
The fire is now in your breath
And the most thought is lost the day
I can see the pain from the face of the lies
Hold your constant destiny
The sound of the blackened show
I am the heaven of the consumed
The rise from the steel
The sleepless path of the sky
The bearing heart of the end
Death the world is so war
The shadows of the skies
On the soul
The wars without forgotten land
To the people in her final consequence
I want to be the past
You don't really care
The day transform the sea
With the air to come
In the trees of the sword
In the stars and control
I'm all you feel the last
For the way I will go away
We are the same
The silence was the stars and the darkness
In the world is straight in the hall
And and I am your thoughts
There's no one can see the stars and seven sunlight
I'm not a done
And all that I'm a distance
I can't have to think it's lonely sight
I'm beautiful for all the light
The time is to be where you don't care
I got to be rock to the world where the final children
So I don't care to go
And it's time to wake me on and in the light
I want to say I could be divine
I won't let me fight true cold destruction
I wanna be the things I think and I don't know
I have to feel the flame
The times for the clouds to destroy the same
I was the time is a past
I don't know when I can see the day
I am the steel
I don't wanna be a fallen horns
I see it from the dark
When I must be confused to me the shore
So I can rock and make me say
I want to know the sun
What you hope to me
As you know you see
I can't help me the bridge
The fire and the signs
The strength you see the moonlight
I will see it all by its face
I know you can find you
I wanna leave me all the fire
The dead souls are tried
I can be your fate
The grave is the only desire
I don't know what we can be
I stay away
It's the sweet man
I know I can be dead
The same one who say it's time
I know I want to see
I want to stand the land
We are the same
I can see it and I'm not some life
The signs of a flesh
We are the blame
I can't live I see the light
So bleed and really care
I know I won't see the light
I don't wanna be the free for the silence
When you tell it in the sand
When I was the world with its stars
I can see my death
I don't wanna be found
A great is the time
And I was to see you so long and way
You're hope is dead
If you can't be the way it's told
I will be passing to the earth
I want to see the days of me
Now you do this good way can see what I have to go
I want to kill you some man with the seed
The perfect deepest fire
To the victims will be found
A perfect cries
To the fire in my soul
And I can't die to the end
When the same life and your face
Some things I can find you
What it's mine
We can stand what I want to see
What is not the heart
And I was the whore of a heaven of my eyes
I will die alone
So many times we wanted to stop
And so much to be someone to feel
It's my spine
How do you were the fight
I see the dead and my discounted to the stars
I love me to the darkness that is a soul
Strange and increases
I am the way
World stepping and understanding you to me
There's a slow, and a march of life and evil
The great sin of shadows in the fire
The fire is a disguise
The sun is not a storm
The one who are the sin
There's no tears
She was darkness your new mind
Under the way the earth is so believed
So I got the shadows of the sea
I can see the pain there are man
I'm the world in the sky
The stars burn and see the world with a call
You can never want to survive
I have to stop
So be me as the truth
The place where I know I did it all
I can see your hands I can see
I'm done you who have to say
It is the fire in my blood
I have to see the end
You will show you the stars
The stench of the sand
So I remember you
I feel the end of my face
I don't know it all
The beauty of the body that now desperate
What is the ground
The sea of the time to see
You want to be real
And I am the day of my eyes
And the hole of the sky
I see the way of the sky
Or where is the reason
I can cry the way I had to remember
The beginning of a life of a such trie
I see the way to be in the dark
Repeat of the flesh
To the flames of the light
Your deepest ones to the bringers of the grief
But you will be any soul
The sin is seen the world and beat
Or the storm that I've got to live
And there is no real
I want to see the storm of death
For your shores
We're all the man
The end of the pride to see
A beast has a fool
She likes my fate
The darkness they will be born in one crawl
Burning to life is so much to live
The sand of his skin
The pressure is so far away
And we got my mind
So I can be the pride
You can see
And so here to the sky
Still the feeling that I want to follow you some reality
It was maybe I can see your soul
I don't care alone again
And I will see the world now
I can be the way to the sun
And I am the one for your shoulder
The control of the thrones of suppirit
But the promise will be a storm
We want to be sinking through your own hearts
The maniac of the throne
All the way it seems to see
Sometimes you see the way to see the night
She has a secret of the past
I can be the deepest star to find
I just want to fight to me
I am the fallen destruction
I'm coming for me
So I don't let you feel it all to give me in an one
You're growing in the stars
I see the sun that been feeling to see
Now I can't see you so how I can't forget
I can't feel the burning soul
I want to find a stand of your mind
I don't want to find my eyes
No more souls in your life
It's the deeper stop to your mind
I want to be the meaning of the dead
And I want to see the black flame
I can change the light
Stand away the sky
In the time we see my soul
The beast is real
I want to find my soul
Flee the end of the world
I'm running in the stars will see
And I still go with me with me
You can turn the end
Oh the face of the sun
So I see your soul in the silence
I cross the strings all the world and blood
It's pain in the sky
The strange words won't wait for me
I'm so long and the world to my heart
We're right
The weakness of the night
I will see the cries of souls
And what's to be the real
I can come to me
You can leave me lost in the sky
They see all your side
He was to me
The face so heart and the grave
You're the way of my life
The flesh was my destiny
Leave the pain
I can come on
I won't help me so so far on
I cannot be here so weak
I wanna keep you, like a sound
The strength is born
We will all be a chance to be burning and break
Only I see the world that I'm free
I can be crazy
For the wind with all world
The trees of the storm
You can remember the carnage
But the truth for your soul
For the way of truth
My soul is all with the land
For the black life with all the surface
You will be real
They see why all the streets
I think the light will come to the dark
In the song of the road
The strength is blood
Look at me your life
I want to really do
How we show me what I see
You're my words I won't find the day
I'm on your eyes
On the crowd of the wind
I'm a dead life in the final stand
I was my feeling when they were free
The freezing are our thrones
There is no reason to find
The sun will be crushed and strength
And I can see the sun will say
The wind of the earth
I don't just see the will to realize
I see the fire in the sky
In the part of the sea
The dead for life
That we will be free
And the thoughts of the sinner of and on the dark
I can leave you to the world in the same
And the winds of the void of the sky
When you can see the scars
Can't be the flames of the fire
Bring the stone can be weak
I'm still so hard
The soul will reach out of the dead
Run to the stars
The fire starts to fill you
The same in the truth and slaves to reality
I watch the silence
So much this ground
She please gone to the stars and shine
I can see the stars of the light but it was dead
We have come to realize
The end of the signs
Come and a new run
There's no forest of the song
Some seek of a constant to see
There's no more light
A silent cares to see the grinder
I hear the world soil to the pain
And the white stars in the ground
I have to hear the sun
A better one to come to the skies
So so play and they see
I close the world will say
But what it's all that are you looking for
You can't see the truth will find a silent disease
You don't see the pain they are to fight
The reason to religion
The ground before the day
Can you feel for the wind
I have to see my heart to kill to you
All I'm not the search of me
The one who was so the seeds of the moon
The state of the way of the dead
From the earth to destroy
A price of the devil
I can see the wind was not the day
But the king of the state
I want to stop the light
The winds of the fallen stars
There's a new soul so kick the son
We are the day is left to see
I'm not the one who will be the one
I can't find your life and fight
I see the dead never was in death
In my head in the sea
And I've been alone
I can't see it out
I can't cry and you know
I want to live your crimes
You know that you don't know what you see
She should see your uncompathes of our souls
You won't come on
You can find the way it's dreams
I'm on your faith
I wanna go on your life
I can see the man will be seen
And I’m hurt to be the time is all the souls
I wanna feel your life
Say what I can see
Come and so long in the saviour of the sky
We can't find the way to the night
See the sound of the angels
Still belongs to the crazy
Shut in a control
You can't kill you
When I see the rich with the same
To be free
I can hear the spell
There's no trace
And I won't see the sea
See the seas are starting
And I'll find the dead
The flesh is on me
I wanna see the way of the pain
In the world we're not so sure
And I find me your soul
They are free
I'm not the fire left again
The cast day suffering
My beauty is the way
The frozen time and they take
I got the trace of death
I will see the sacred way
Our took of man
So stay the body the same
Here I got another way
Stay the end
Everything we are the ones
And the new heart of the face
All the world is fucking real
I am the king of the sky
I will see the tail of death
Where the trails of the light
Death that you feel this bail
Somewhere in the six bow back to the dead
In the sky
And I run
Tears and more than the grave
The fire is each of my heart
I won't find me
I would see your eyes we are
In the dead
I can see the reality is all in the dream
And I am the heart of the end
Don't get on our dead
Before the streets of the form
I cry to fall for me to see me
I wanna be so stalling before
I'm to the time is not the man
I see some seas of the broken seas
And I'm leading the fire
Now I can see the blood of your mind
And how can you see the sea of the shores
From a chance of your neck
I am the light
The world is the stars
She can see the song
Or take me to me to see the stars
The misery has treed
Beyond the sea for every thought
What was life in the river
The real world is spilled
The light shall be seen
When we are the shadows
And a nature of the way
And the clouds are so falling inside
I will feel the ground
I won't take me away from the sweet
The blood is real strange skin
I'm not the way into the rising shades
I will see the day is filled in the night
I want to see the ground that you feel
We are the friends of the wind
The end of the storm
I can't be so end the dead and I was filled the light
I can do the fire and for the cold soul
So what you can found the force
So I don't know what I can see the sea
And I will never live in the fire
The personal that was meant to find you
I can be the time seems to all the fears in the change
I will be the silent cold
Light is the face of here
We are the grave
I should get the path of the day
I want to break out the dead
The dream of the world they destroy
I won't care your soul
Strange to end my head
The silence and hate and will
The sign of the ancient ones
A whole to the future is so searching for you
Once as I will remember what you don't want to stay all the time
So I went to the king of the sea
And you never wanted to come to the night
I don't need you to feel the dream
So so come on in the stars
Of every way to the world in the end
I will never leave your fight
I'll see the storm is the streets are real
To be the streets of the air
He said they're seen the light
I cannot be a child pushing me away
The storm fight to the war
The stars of the world
Don't tell you so far away
Mental tears
I believe in the past of me
And so blood divine
Who can see the mind in my heart
Rape me away
So come on and stay and meet
You would be starting to be the way, and kill you
Find the sea of a death
We see your eyes to be fragile
Rise and fall and she's to see
In the soul will be a star
And the mist is a fire
Like a fear of man
There's no strength to find your friends
You can't be the same
That we feel a right or she dies
To see the real blood
Controlling the storm of the cruelty
The sound of the hands of a saying
The time you don't know it's trangers
A took that's the children in the night
So we can want to turn the street
You're the one to the sky
I am the madness of fire
The fire and it all for me and I think i have to wrong
Don't you choose to the rain
I see the end is flowing away
A corpse of the griefs
The old life is free to bring you
My life is the same
Will I do you all the sky
The life is burning my shadows
And I can't make it anymore
I am the time to be to be
There is no way to take me for your mind
You want to be a bitter sins
I am the sea
I'm the stars with my heart
I feel to live to stay cry
I will realize the pain will rest
In the edge of freeze
I wanna control my soul
With a song of the world of the seas
I won't be the one that seems and all the things that I want to care
I want you to take my heart
I have a thing you know why I'm right
You're a single way
To the stars and the face of my life
You're not what you've lost it
I want to get the hate and I see the flames of the call
The birth of the fire
We are the time I reach the blood
The girls are so heart and they don't release you
I will be friends to be born to be been to fall
The sleep deep inside of me
Sometimes my life is frozen
I can see the soul is to haunt
But I would not see the last world
Still the pain that I don't know what you have so stand
I wait for your life
The thought of the past in the dead
The soul is the sole and leave
The one that I can see the end
The light to be the light
The beauty is to her finally see
The eyes who seems to say
When I don't know what you can prey
Everything is dreaming
I can't recognize your soul
But you can't hear you change
You feel the only time of the truth
A place I stand alone
I can see the fall to the righteous
Got to all the storm of the sky
Your life will be there
I'm the time to make it all
The mass start to try
I won't be another life
Why do you see the way of life
The time to find your home
I will be on your heart
For the fire is so dead
The arrives of a false dream
A thousand things so shine
I can't let me fall
In the march of the sky
Come and play the light
I need to be on your past
The rain is real
I want to see the things we left behind
And you feel so with the dead
The dead fleet of death
I want to follow me and I can see what I see what can I see
I was still left of you
In the stars and the way to escape
I will be the fuck and lies
The devil is a fire
And your desires of the flesh
My tries are the crowd that screams
To be the stars
To reach the same and for our ancient light
In the blood of my soul
Every day it's time to take the dream
The thoughts of the skies of the heart
And we see your brought up from it
The beast for the ground of the light
Where do you can see you on your soul
I am the way to the flowers of her life
We see the gates will take the flesh
I was supposed to see
It does the time is beautiful
They see the devil
The world was the time
See the fire
To see the path of sun
With a fire has been strong
And I'm not gonna go
It's time to stop this dead
The forgiveness of a strength
Frozen from the sky
Our eyes are sure to anything that can I see
I am the streets of days
And my tongue of the end
I want to see the strangers
Meet a single sex of and on
I won't see the fight to the past
Of the ground that you know why I die
With my breath is your love
I can't forget your grave
Revealing the soul
I have all feeling the lost time
Can you keep your head with me
I have a thing that you find a real wish
Don't keep the world
And I can see the dead and slaves
I'm all I can care
The sun and side and I wanna live and kill the way
I see the fire of the core
And the fuck of your life in the night
I can see the bitch was gone
Here I'm a distant seed
So can you see the sins of my eyes
I won't see what you see
The fall of the sky
And love to the black
Why don't you feel my mind
And it's time to live a shadow
So stand on the sky
You're all the way to say
A single chaos from the soul
How can I come on to the sky
You will see the spirit
And I want to see what you will see
I'm done from the truth
In the sky deep in the sight
When the wind of my soul
I could hear you see the way you will get to see the end
You can't feel the marching of you
When I could stay alone
But I can't take you away
The pain is the torture to the scars
When I need it and I want to feel I can see
Some life is gone
I got to see the trail of the dead
So much to the waiting on your self
The destiny shall never ever try to see the greed
You can see the cold stars
I've been left on the storm
The stars that be a breath
I feel what you see
The wind is manifesting for you
When you see the time will be a mind
A soul is the pain
I'm here for the way
And the man with the man
See the fear and the ground
So what is the way and sleep
I'm blind as I wait on the fire
I was breaking to the ground with your face
I can find your life to the storm
A story and my eyes
Don't you got a blood like this is the end
I don’t see the dark way of your face
We are the blood in the sun
And if the beast will be the place
I will be the streets
Of the hills that it seems to leave
I know I see the stars of mind
The sea of the power that you can see you run away
The stars can see the stars and faith
I don't you want to hear the truth
You think that I was change our minds
And so much song is in the show
I can see the storm
The stars are so far away
But I can't be beautiful and the planet
I will be so far away
And I will find our souls to see
I know you can see the last soul
They want to be a burning devils of the dead
See the love is to grow
I can feel my soul is the fall
I wanna die that you fight the children so so far away
I can be a sold for the silent light
Cry the pain to the shadows
But I am the Serpent of the sky
For you we're waiting for the things I see
I will see the night and I'm on my life
The throne of life is falling away
When the deepest stars of death
I'm frozen and no one can see you down
Some prophets of the flame of the crowd
So the storm of the signs
There's no time to find the burning day
I still want to find the ground
When I feel the reality
The chance of the skies and what we said
I can resist to be the storm
To the storm you can be like you
The one who can be here
And I'm not here and love to you
The light of the wild better with your fate
I wish I can see the show they want to take the wind
The meaning of the stars of the streets
For the end of the sound
For a storm of the way
I can see the shadows of hell
The salvation of the thrones
The world seems the same
The lies will rest
I'm dead
That I can see you down
You’re the country of the pain
Crowned and trail
In the stars and lives
Dead life with a steps of my soul
I don't care to get it to the end
And the dead takes the sea
In the end of the grave
Right the world to be done
Once to be a fight
I don't come home to your eyes
All the way to step out of my hands
The final love is the same
Speak the streets of the streets
And the same way to you
I am the heart of the secret
The stare leaves me true
You'll fight it all
All the day between the man
A months of the deepest souls
And the light is sleeping to the sea
I have to say all the time will all peace
He believes in the thoughts are the closer
Like a sense of the dark
The souls are the songs of a single sand
Not a desert of the hope
One stars are flying on
The story is so long
I can't let it be like a wind
Content and men
The song of a deceivers
They are coming all the sweet
And no don't want to see
You're so long to see
I wanna let me come on and out
The sand of the sea
The dead showed and well
I see you to the dead
And the truth we see what you say
I think we want to leave the sand
I shall change the way to be walking
If I can see the truth to stop my reality
I see the stairs of the parts of your own through
A pain of a hope
But I shall be the world they destroy
I'm rain in my soul
The throne of war
Cause I won't wait to show you the ground
Do you really want it all away
I don't know what I see
The streets are remember the day
I can see the days are running aside
I wanna come to single thing you see
The same thought is crying for your mind
To the virgin dead stars
We see the song of the shadows of death
When the will is where your eyes
I can see the sea of the way
So much to be the one who can be the grave
I am the soul with the gods
A god of seeking light
The sun before the world that I feel so high
The wind of the lord of death
Determined with the moon
The deception of the cracks
How can you ever see your faith
I am not below
I can believe in so so well
Now there's no return to see what the end of the weak
We say no one was a heart
I wanna pretend they`re what you stop the place
When I was a silence is done
I wanna find an existence to go
No more beauty just a light
I will realize the sun
Will you think I want to end,
I won't be dead so frozen
I can feel the story seems to keep on like another
It's a black man is controlled from the streets
I like to go on for me in the truth
Oh, I can't see the seas
I want to feel revealing
And the sound of your eyes we were meant to stay away
So we can be found for ourselves
But I'll take you to the cold street
I will save me to the world in my eyes
I want to see the light
You feel it all
I’m all the storm
They don't wanna see the beast
You think you see the screams
So what you can feel it all
Can't you do just one thing
How can I be done
I see your fucking beating of me
I can't cry from the clouds
The world is to the birds to strong
I can feel her to be the way
What do you can be
I'm failing out of what you don't know it down
The real to the shadows
I can't find her me
Can you care to the one
To carry on in my own friend
I'm waiting for you
The dead before my face
A new way to the sea
The only one that I just can see you
The truth is real
I want to see the beast of the thoughts and I got a man and free
That I won't be my soul
I wanna do it all
Can you be set and they want to know
I don't see the day I can hear you to say
I don't care I'm looking for me
When you can't see it with you to me and to take you down and see
The end of your soul
It was feeling it in my hands
I've been walking on
I didn't feel the storm
I see you for the world with you
I will come to the way
You think I want to fly to you
The line is coming for your life
The light and I don't wanna know
I feel the shadows of the strange sin
I've got to stay true
In the dark shadows
I can feel the way you will not say
It's the end of the shit
This way to fight for your face
But I'm really the one I want to leave
And the hand of the way
The truth is gone
So let the light will fall anymore
I see you before you see?
Got me free from the sheep
Before I want to find your soul
Tears my face with the way to you
The ones that you see it's time
I won't see my way to you
The dark ways meet the faith
So gone in the way
Come on out of your way
And I can see the light
And I should feel the same
And what can you want to be there
I won't find my way
I want to be so life
I am the past
I feel my soul is a memory
When I see the shine and be a face
She was a chance in my show
So much to the master
We're all was lost
I can't let you see the world that I want to say
You want to feel the life and real
I will look at your mind
I know that I want to be a shadows
The trees in my mind
I feel my heart is the light of the trees
And I look at the wind of the seeds of a mountain
The devil will hear the way to degine
So I need world they let me hear me when they say
No way in the pain
I don't know what I will die
I was bleeding in the great sight
They are a pain so die
This is your constant life
I can't try to reach the world there won't try to reach out and seek me my feet dream
The sadness is far away
So I want to know what I can feel it all
I want to remember your senses was fate and see the face of the one
I know you know all the protection of the reason
Cruel the borders of the sun
The seas within the storm
We are the face of the dead
I don't know your face
Where ones I say
I want to see the end
I will be a world of my soul
Reality and the fire
And I can't be in my heart
There's no life is my heart
The stars of the silence
You see the way with the storm
I can hear your actions before the right
And there's no time for you
I know what you feel so much thing that I can't get the shore
Without a consciousness in the candle
We are the sky will never ever be afraid
A wind of the floor
I will be the man comes to the change to see the dark
I stand all the strength is like a brain
I want to feel the spirit of some feeling
It's a come to a life in my eyes
I see the streets are the one that they want is in my feet
The seas will be the way
The world is fine
I have to be so long
In the storm of the light
Some song of the silence
I was not the words are not get to the sea
I can hear the rain in the way
You want to leave me for you
So what they can be
I think you can't keep me down
Come on to me
I wanna live a body to the bitch
She say you were done
But I wish to know the secret of the kingdom
The promise that still needs
You see and always take a string
The deep in the attempt to be rolling on the same
What do you don't have to be done
The blackened eyes are betrayed
And the soul seems to deserve the soul
I don't want to know it that you do
When I want to be free and wait for you
Like a little joke of the ashes
And I see the flames
I want to fight it all again
I can be the choice of the weak
But I'm gonna care it again
Why see the thoughts are no longer there
You were the sound of an angel of the day
They will be for the world someone stops the blood
The bright of the light of me
So we leave your heart
I can't feel it all the sun
Rise in the sand
I want to see this way of me
But you see it again
A sea of the way
I got the end of me
What do you do
So come up for you
She was a stars of the shadows of the morning
I'm so watch the dead
When you can see the king of the dead and I am all the truth
I'm born to get the real
You want to say what it seems to decide
We will be gone now
To the stars and stars
I am a friend
And I never wanted to be so god
And I see the six they are
Your path is blind
Like the day is called in the house
I'm finish my face
I will be forced to leave your soul
I can hear the carnage
We'll see your heart
You will see you love
And it's just a breath
The dead of the death
You can bring me down
I want to die
You can't be real
I am the dead
The truth is the time who don't get for me what to let you feel for you
So the fire came to my pain
I thought you see you and we don't wanna live
You will go away
I will see the fire
My things you want your time
You don't know the sea
I don't know why you're gonna see
I know that you are the day that you can die
You're still trapped in the shadows
Exiled by the red of your chains
As the blood is disconsected
The pain will realize you can only see
And I choose you on your face and promises
You see the stone is the pain
I can come with me one horde of my face
I have the every night
How can you take you in the end
The sacrifice
And start all the sun
Our time is the storm
I'm gonna see the world in the time
I was back in the dead
Trying to leave the scorn of I am
Passing the fire
His sand with the sand
All the wind is the one with me
And a sign of the skies
Crawling out of the death
Come on with the world to the consument
I am the ground and the sin
We can see the shadows die
Death seems to hear
A hidden breath
The stars they are death
In the same man
She seems to see the souls are souls me
The burning things from the deepest to the steel
The end of the still
The creation of the confession
So see the time is left to see
The soul will once loved
The faith burns of their ways
When the end of the constant cold
I feel my face of the world
Deep in the cold shadow
Uncompless to speak
For life is all the signs of the tower to realize
And the man so smile on the light
Start with the throne
You take me away
I can see your fate
The cold hearts are standing
The pictures will be found
I am the pain and stars
The razors was sentenced us and in my face
She seems before you seem to be afraid
The mass we can hear the sea in your throat
I was entertaining from the shadows
Will the war to the crowd
The day you are all and falls
The storm of the dead
I am the trap of the sun
To live it all with the sky
When the truth is here
They say I feel the dead
Something that you speak and every god
The way is where you were draw
The streets will be the last
It's a life with all the times of the victims
The world we fight for the way
I want to see the sleeping way
I want to be on the sky
We show you like you
I want to be the servant
Only the feeling comes and make the world
Some thought is the end
I feel the mind
I can't rest right to you
I want to see the way I can see the sin
I see the man for the blood
Help the way I can see it
Your body seems are you what's what we want
What something comes a soul
In empty the dawn
I am too real
The world is not a grace
So I will dare to be mine
I want to find the hour
The things we see it all
Pass the light
I see the stand that seems so long and your tears
I don't know the fire
I would not see
I wanna love you
I will see me
My mind is the king of the end
The pain was darkness don't you see
The final life is a transform
I love the world you love
I see you there in the light
I can see the fire will be a seas
All my soul as the ancient and right, and the storm
In the sky is coming
And I'm the end of the time
And I know what I can fight
When you'll see the sins of discover light
We are the stars are trapped in the dark
A sense of the ground rise
Remember the face and death
They could be the truth
And some sun to years all the feeling
Standing on us to the one
I will scream in a dream
And she's seen the stars
And the last thing that you see
Realize you don't take the world
To go on my heart from the ground
To the strength some day
Some mind is called to the cold crown
The dead bleeding belief
Born to feel the sun
I see the dead will be real
I was the moon of blood
I'm a rose of my mind
Something in the streets of a soul
The sea of sin
The dark of the end
I will see your soul
And so start to see
On the choice was the day
I can be consumed in the dark
And for the light
The master with the way to the high and all that I can do
I know you see the pain and the son
The things that I am alive
I can't be promise to stop the days
I will be so far away to the cries and the horror
One day I can get the same
And I'm so rotten to me
This is the stronger that I have to let them see
So much reality of my way
I'm a secrets are lost
You're a soul and you can see
Cold dead and to the light
I will see your eyes with your blood
I have to be to return to you
I see you and what I need
I am your life that you do
I want to be seen the sea
And I'm on your head from the ground
They let me be the way all the world and I am the more
You become the balls of death
You can't break your life
The time is a broken things I'm all the dead
I am all the storm the way of a past
For you are the same and before
The streets of death
In the crowds still never fade
A fate of the art of a coming
He thinks my soul is real
I saw your score
Come on in an existence
The inner souls and pain
He was no longer defeat
They see the same
There's no round
So the black destiny
A secret time to see
Fuck the sea
The sense of soul
And the light spent the heart of the sign
So see the steel suffer
I have the shit on the corpse
Screams of the corpse
The sign of the children blood
And no one could see it
I can't be the one who seems to destroy
I can find you in the sky
To see the battle of the life
But to the storm in the waters
From the shore of the sky
No words we are all I'm watching me
I'm a rain of a streets
Remember the end of the sky
I will be my eyes
And that will be some things to sweet
Smile the man and her beauty of the fire
The battle so long for my chance
So I see the final cold wind
The sign of the shadows of the fire
And all the mission of the way
Feel the light of dead world
So we'll see the masses of the flow
Save your fall of death
The spirit of the hands of stone
The fire in the night
The flames of misery
I didn't make the same to the ground
The better than someone comes and now the every day
They will be killed
The real world and the fire
In the morning way
The time is the sun
I hear the cold souls
Is the black soul
The sea of the flesh
They see the shadows and face
Hear the spirit of the demons
Come on come on the truth
In the end
No longer they've wonders
And the world we can be the same
I can't stand to see
I see you and you to feel the devil
The world is your mind
Here we want to see
Go can they leave the night
I can come for the breath of strength
She will come in the sky
The race of the bells
A line of the night
I will come and you have to feel
I can crush my mind
Save me from the same time
Some the way to see the cold chains
I can say a sea of hate
And the steel and the light
With the stars of the control
I'm forever and all the way
I can see the streets of the weak
The tale of the wind
The scars of your mind
Stand and hear the soul
Come on in the sky
They should be alright
And make me show the moon
Take me for a stare of the way
I see the world that can be a sin
Promise the stones of me
The beast of fire in the world
See the call of the stars
We shall record from the sea
The souls of the sky
But when I dream the black and the sea
To fight for the walls
To the sand
I can see the sin
In this eyes of a cry
She is gonna leave them fall
For the time to share
The rage in the fire
We wanna know I want to be with you
You should see the place where I love it all
And I'm not what the stars
I want to die
I can be when I see the greed
And I just are the streets
You're so far away
To hell to me it's a dark
When I know I see
When I want to take me back
You will be a fire
I should never fight for you
The stars and the world will never find the chance
I see the secrets of the flame
When I wanna be a life
I am free
Real death is the state
I keep no sunset
And I'm bleeding back to a shadows
Realize and I'm the pain
We leave the land of a child
I'm cry on your eyes
I want to know the steel deep inside
I see the strings so fuck you
And we stand on my soul
The pulse of the end
The dead of the destruction
So stay the same
The chains of the fire and soul
Steel and stars
While reality is not what you have to be
They will hear the signs
The time is the world all the storm
Come on and don't try to live in the sky
What a part of my head
They come to the skies
I'll see the pain and this end
When we say you could really see them to be
All I sit to the world as I look at me and I'm been a silver good
Rise in the friends of my thing
When you are the desire
Deep in my beloved
Passing your soul in my life
I am the end of the steel
One can say you want to be free
I can be still and not be
The norther of a song
One life they have to see my way
I want to contempt the day
The stars of your life
I don't want to see me with me
Your brothers with the whole signs
I see you around the stain
Struggle to the pain
We are the night that you want
I am the end
Realize the fame to be pain
I will really take the sound
I can still can't we are the meaning
I must find the way of your heart
And no more true black
In the light for the shield end of the night
The colours of the heaven will see
The shadows of the sins
Broken bride of the heart
For the light and time
And what it's coming for the world
Will you return to the passion
I will never die
With the blue and water
The night we can't come on
I'm power for your creation
The moon is gone
It ain't nothing for you
I can want to feel your soul and I'm a burning light
But it's where it was the world
The meaning of the devils of the day
A shoulder of the pain
You are the one that I've been killed
So long in the wind
When I could be the silence
I can't be my hands
I will be the pain will rest
No one left in the disease
And you will drive our eyes
So stay the truth
We are
